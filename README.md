# NWTooltipFix

#### For use on Atlantiss, Netherwing.

## What does it do

As you may know Netherwing is progressing through the patches of TBC, meaning some items and boss abilities will be in their old states and while the server holds these values, the 2.4.3 client can't always correctly display them. This addon allows you to see these values correctly.

An example of these changes would be Leatherworking Drums not being usable while shapeshifted and having a 1 sec cast time.


## How to install

Click the green 'Clone or download' button and select 'Download ZIP'. Extract the folder and rename it to NWTooltipFix (remove the '-master' part.) Copy to your World of Warcraft/Interface/AddOns folder and you're done!


### Remember to remove this addon on patch 2.3!
