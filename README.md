# NWTooltipFix

#### For use on Atlantiss, Netherwing.

## What does it do

As you may know Netherwing is progressing through the patches of TBC, this means some items and boss abilities will be in their old states and while the server has these values, the 2.4.3 client can't always show these old item states. This addon will allow you to see these old item attributes correctly.

For istance Drums not being usable while shapeshifted and bonus damage from healing items.


## How to install

Click the green 'Clone or download' button and select 'Download ZIP'. Extract the folder and rename it to NWTooltipFix (remove the '-master' part.) Copy to your World of Warcraft/Interface/AddOns folder and you're done!


### Remember to remove this addon when patch 2.3 hits, it will no longer be needed then!
